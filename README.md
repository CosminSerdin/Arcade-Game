Paddle Class: The Paddle class defines the behavior of the paddles on both sides of the screen. Each paddle can move up and down, providing players with precise control over their gameplay. The paddles are equipped with methods for upward and downward movement, making them responsive to user input.

Ball Class: The Ball class handles the physics and motion of the game ball. It moves at a customizable speed and bounces off the top and bottom walls to keep the game challenging. The ball also interacts with the paddles, bouncing off them when collided.

Scoreboard Class: The Scoreboard class is responsible for tracking and displaying the scores of both players. It provides real-time updates on the score.

User Interaction: The game supports user interaction through keyboard input. Players can control the right paddle using the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys, while the left paddle can be controlled with the "W" and "S" keys.

Game Logic: The game's core logic is implemented within a while loop, ensuring continuous gameplay until a winner is determined. The ball's behavior, including bouncing off walls and paddles, is meticulously handled to create a challenging and fun gaming experience.

Game Over and Reset: When one of the players scores a point, the ball is reset to the center of the screen, and the respective player's score is updated.

Graphics and Animation: The game's graphics are rendered using Turtle graphics, providing a visually appealing and retro-style gaming experience. The screen.update() method ensures smooth animation without flickering.
